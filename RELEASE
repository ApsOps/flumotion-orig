Release notes for Flumotion 0.9.1 "Jazz"
        
The Flumotion team announces
a new release of the development 0.9 branch
of the Flumotion Streaming Server.

Flumotion is a streaming media server created with the backing of
Fluendo. It features intuitive graphical administration tools, making
the task of setting up and manipulating audio and video streams easy for
even novice system administrators. Flumotion is released under the LGPL.


Features of this release

      * We have included a producer and a consumer that can comunicate using
        gdp using authentication. Flumotion can now be used as an external
        encoder to qpush to another flow without sharing the manager.
      * Blackmagic SDI capture cards support.
      * Modifiable properties: Theora and VP8 encoder's bitrate can now be
        modified through flumotion-command (admin UI comming soon!).
        e.g. flumotion-command component -i "/default/encoder-video" invoke modifyProperty bitrate 400
