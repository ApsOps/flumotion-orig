Release notes for Flumotion 0.8.0 "7 Portes"
        
The Flumotion team announces
a new release of the stable 0.8 branch
of the Flumotion Streaming Server.

Flumotion is a streaming media server created with the backing of
Fluendo. It features intuitive graphical administration tools, making
the task of setting up and manipulating audio and video streams easy for
even novice system administrators. Flumotion is released under the GPL.


Overview

Since last year's stable release a lot of improvements have been done in the
development branch (a.k.a. trunk) which we're proud to launch now with this
new stable series.

A new format has been added to the flumotion famlilly of supported open
formats: VP8 with WebM. After supporting it for some months we've thought it
was already time to ship an stable release including it, now that the encoder
and muxer have been stabilized in the latest stable GStreamer.

Other than that, we've spent most of the time on fixing existing issues
detected since the last stable release and improving the user experience by
adding more features to the wizard and the administration tool.

Below is the summary of the user-visible changes from the last stable release
codenamed "Can Punyetes". From this point new features will only be added and
released in the new 0.9 development series. The stable branch will get bugfixes
however.


Features of this release

      * Added Twisted 2.5 compatibility. Dropped Twisted < 2.5 compatibility.

      * Streamers and servers have at their disposal a new kind of bouncer:
        The "multi-bouncer", with it you can combine different bouncers into
        one generic bouncer.

      * New effects have been added to enable video and audio post-processing:
        deinterlace, videorate, videoscale and audiorate are now available.
        Those functionalities have been decoupled from the producers code and
        now are handled homogeneously.

      * You'll notice a big improvement of the video quality when streaming in
        full PAL from a firewire camera thanks to the integration of those
        effects in this producer.
        Note: this introduces a new dependency on gstreamer-ffmpeg

      * The new fileprovider-httpcached plug helps on providing files from
        another HTTP server performing local caching.

      * A new type of component has been added: the decoder components.
        For now only the generic-decoder is available. It can produce raw
        audio and video from an input stream and use them as input for other
        encoders.

      * Added live WebM/VP8 support.

      * It is now possible to load an existing configuration from the wizard.

      * When the admin is closed it asks, if needed, to stop the worker and
        manager started from the greeter.

      * The wizard now checks for the existence of the needed muxers and
        prompts the user with a message if they are not installed.

      * The contents of the ondemand server are now browseable from
        the admin in a directory-like interface.

      * From the admin it is now possible to add new streamers from an already
        running flow.
